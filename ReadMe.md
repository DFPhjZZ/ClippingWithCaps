This project uses clipping planes to achieve similar effects when slicing a model. 

But currently there is only one clipping plane, and shader tricks instead of actual stencil buffers are used here.  Additionally, only obj files are supported thus far.

Future plans including add multiple clipping planes, use stencil buffers, etc.
